! Configuration File for keepalived

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface eth0
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 150
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass $ place secure password here.
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        10.32.75.200
    }
}
Create the config file on the second server (10.32.75.14):

vim /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
Edit and paste the following config:

! Configuration File for keepalived

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface eth0
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 100
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass $ place secure password here.
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        10.32.75.200
    }
}
The priority must be highest on the server you want to be the master/primary. It can be 150 on the master, and 100, 99, 98, 97 on the slaves. The virtual_router_id must be the same on all nodes and the auth_pass must also be the same. My network configuration is on eth0, change it if yours is on another one.

Configuring NGINX
For this example I have set up a very simple NGINX server with a very simple HTML page.

vim /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
Server 1:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Keepalived 1!</title>
<style>
    body {
        width: 35em;
        margin: 0 auto;
        font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
    }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Keepalived 1 - MASTER!</h1>
</body>
</html>
Server 2:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Keepalived 2!</title>
<style>
    body {
        width: 35em;
        margin: 0 auto;
        font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
    }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Keepalived 2 - backup!</h1>
</body>
</html>
sysctl
In order to be able to bind on a IP which is not yet defined on the system, we need to enable non local binding at the kernel level.

Temporary:

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_nonlocal_bind
Permanent:

Add this to /etc/sysctl.conf:

net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1
Enable with:

sysctl -p
